Twiturr 0.01

Experiment with Android SDK and Twitter's OAuth APIs

Twiturr uses signpost-commonhttp library to create a webview inside the app
and allows user to authenticate with their twitter account.

OAuth provides authentication without the need of storing users password 
on the device by means of getting temporary (expires in a very long time)
consumer keys once the user is authenticated via twitters website.
